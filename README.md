# my100daysOfCode
In this repository I document my journey for the 100 days of Coding challenge


**Day 27 and 28**.
- Today I worked on the importance of Data Structures and Algorithms in Javascript. 
- And I also worked on some coding challenge and watched some React coding interview for beginner coding with Clement the founder of AlgoExpert.
- I also learn how to construct an object, how to make chikd object inherit from it parent object and how to use prototype to make more objects. And finally how to build prototype of unrelated objects using mixin.

***Day 29/100 July 4th 2022***.
- Today I am working on Immediately Invoked Function Expression (IIFE). 

- At first I did not know that you can actually declare a function and call it on the spot, But thanks to this challenge from freeCodeCamo, I was able to learn that.  It is actually pretty easy  to understand.
- 
- I am at the last challenge about the OOP in JavaScript. If I finish this, I will get into functional programming, I hope it will be very resourcefull for my future projects.
