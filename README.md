# my100daysOfCode
In this repository I document my journey for the 100 days of Coding challenge



## Day 30/100 July 5th 2022

- Imperative code. Instead of using for loop we can use map().

## Day 29/100 July 4th 2022
- Today I am working on Immediately Invoked Function Expression (IIFE). 
- At first I did not know that you can actually declare a function and call it on the spot, But thanks to this challenge from freeCodeCamo, I was able to learn that.  It is actually pretty easy  to understand.
- I am at the last challenge about the OOP in JavaScript. If I finish this, I will get into functional programming, I hope it will be very resourcefull for my future projects.
- I am also learning callbacks ( functions that are slipped or passed into another function to decide the invocation of that function.
- First class functions are functions assigned to variable, passed as parameter of other function or returned from another function just like any other normal value. callbacks are also first class function.
- Function tha take a function as a parameter or return a function as a return value is called higher order function.

## Day 27 and 28 July 2nd and July 3rd 2022
- Today I worked on the importance of Data Structures and Algorithms in Javascript. 
- And I also worked on some coding challenge and watched some React coding interview for beginner coding with Clement the founder of AlgoExpert.
- I also learn how to construct an object, how to make chikd object inherit from it parent object and how to use prototype to make more objects. And finally how to build prototype of unrelated objects using mixin.
