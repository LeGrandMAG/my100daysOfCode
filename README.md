<h4> In this repository I document my journey for the 100 days of Coding challenge</h4>



## Day 30/100 July 5th 2022

- Imperative code. Instead of using for loop we can use map().
- in functional programming changing  things is called mutation and the outcome is called side effect.
- We use map() as a replacement of for loop or ForEach.
- We use filter() to select specific element that meet a certain standard.
- We use reduce() to compute the sum of elements.
- We use sort(). And we need to always remember callback functions comparedFunction while using sort() method.
- We will use split() to  convert a string into an array
- We will use join() to convert an array into a string.

In  today's challenge we tried to convert a string into a url slug. With such a simple formula. 
```function urlSlug(title) {
title = title.toLowerCase()
return title.split(/\W/).filter(item => item !== '').join('-')
```
 - We also learn how to use the "every" method. We use it to check if all the element of an array satisfy a condition in the callback function and return true or false.
 - We use some() to check if any of tghe element in an array satisfy a condition and return true or false.

Also learned about currying an partial application.

Arity of a function is the number of arguments it requires. Currying a function means we convert a function of N arity into N functions of arity 1. We restructures a function so it takes one argument.
Currying a function is useful if you cannot supply all arguments to a function at one time. 

Partial application...DID NOT REALLY GRASP THIS CONCEPT

~~~ Now I just started working on the Intermediate Algoruthm Scripting Challenge ~~~

## Day 29/100 July 4th 2022
- Today I am working on Immediately Invoked Function Expression (IIFE). 
- At first I did not know that you can actually declare a function and call it on the spot, But thanks to this challenge from freeCodeCamo, I was able to learn that.  It is actually pretty easy  to understand.
- I am at the last challenge about the OOP in JavaScript. If I finish this, I will get into functional programming, I hope it will be very resourcefull for my future projects.
- I am also learning callbacks ( functions that are slipped or passed into another function to decide the invocation of that function.
- First class functions are functions assigned to variable, passed as parameter of other function or returned from another function just like any other normal value. callbacks are also first class function.
- Function tha take a function as a parameter or return a function as a return value is called higher order function.

## Day 27 and 28 July 2nd and July 3rd 2022
- Today I worked on the importance of Data Structures and Algorithms in Javascript. 
- And I also worked on some coding challenge and watched some React coding interview for beginner coding with Clement the founder of AlgoExpert.
- I also learn how to construct an object, how to make chikd object inherit from it parent object and how to use prototype to make more objects. And finally how to build prototype of unrelated objects using mixin.
